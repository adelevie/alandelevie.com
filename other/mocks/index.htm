      This is the first paragraph of a titled article, which may be viewed in its entirety or only an excerpt shown. Unlike my current site, I think I should include a separate excerpt field on an article, which if present will cause just the excerpt to be shown with a "more" link of some sort.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My leading contender for a "more" link is a large column-wide bar with an arrow or something. Full articles will have a more dedicated presentation on their own permalink page. I'm not sure yet if the commenting workflow will differ between "articles" with titles, and regular articles. Certainly it'd be technically easier if there was no difference.

      A description of the song, could be short, or could be long. Or, it could be very very long. How about even more long? What about even more more more long long long long? Enough to overcome the margin beneath the play button, perhaps.

    <p>
      The first paragraph of a small, title-less post. In this I ruminate on a short subject or something and then carry on with my life. It will involve one, two, or possibly ten paragraphs, the point is that it's not a canonical thing that I expect other people to visit - but, it will have a permalink and all that just in case. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A title will still be entered into the database and a slug generated, but the title will not be shown, although it will be present in the HTML (just marked as invisible). The slug and title will be utilitarian and descriptive.
