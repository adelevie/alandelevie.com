      This is the first paragraph of a titled article, which may be viewed in its entirety or only an excerpt shown. Unlike my current site, I think I should include a separate excerpt field on an article, which if present will cause just the excerpt to be shown with a "more" link of some sort.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My leading contender for a "more" link is a large column-wide bar with an arrow or something. Full articles will have a more dedicated presentation on their own permalink page. I'm not sure yet if the commenting workflow will differ between "articles" with titles, and regular articles. Certainly it'd be technically easier if there was no difference.

        Before acting, I wanted to become a journalist. I also toyed with the idea of being a chef - but that's only when people asked me what I wanted to be. In fact, I always used to say I wanted to be an actor, but I didn't ever believe that I was good enough to be come one.

        Love is something that never goes out of style. It's something everybody experiences, and if they are not in love, people usually want to feel that. So if you hear the album, it's very romantic. Meeting you was fate, becoming your friend was a choice, but falling in love with you I had no control over.
